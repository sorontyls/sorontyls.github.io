  Hi, my name's Paul and I've loved creating pieces of software since a long time. I started my professional career more than 10 years ago with a focus on
  working on 3D rendering engines for the industry, then towards interactive 3D application on iPads (with the help of Unity 3D).
  
  Now it has been 6 years since I changed a bit and have been working on cybersecurity solutions.

  Since this change I've been doing a lot of different things I'll summerize below.

          I have been working on cybersecurity solutions for various platforms.

            I have been involved in many project and have worked with the following languages and technologies:
            <mark>C</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Objective-C</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Jenkins</mark>, <mark>Windows</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>iOS</mark>, <mark>Kanban</mark>, <mark>Jira</mark>

            I've also been working with client/server architecture and have used some cryptography concepts.

            This is a game for Apple Watch and the first and only personal project I've released to the App Store.
          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            This is a little game I developped to learn <mark>Swift</mark> and also as a challenge to myself to find a game-mechanic working well with the limited inputs available on an Apple Watch.

            It told me lots of little things about the hardware itself as well as the toolchain and the validation process for the App Store.

            Unfortunately, my personal life as changed quite a bit since the inception of this project and left me with too little time to update my codebase to follow API changes, hardware changes and fix some remaining bugs. 
            (I also had some more ideas I wanted to test, but they will have to wait a little longer)

          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I introduce students to x86 and x86_64 assembly with a focus on cybersecurity. I teach them the architecture of Intel processor without going too deep. 
            
            I then show them how a program is compiled and how the assembly code looks like. We do some static analysis (with <mark>IDA</mark> and <mark>ghidra</mark>) before some dynamic analysis on windows program with 
            <mark>x64dbg</mark>. Finally I led them to exploit a simple buffer overflow vulnerability to show them how all of these concepts can be used together.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
